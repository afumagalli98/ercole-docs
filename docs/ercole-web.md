## Installation guide

This installation guide is for RHEL8, but the steps can be adapted for RHEL7 (using `rhel7` instead of `rhel8`).

- `curl https://repository.ercole.io/shared/ercole-rhel8-noarch.repo | tee /etc/yum.repos.d/ercole-noarch.repo`
- `yum install ercole-web`
  The website files can be found under `/usr/share/ercole/web/`.
  If you want setup nginx for serving the files and proxy-pass you can follow this [HOWTO](#how-to-setup-ercole-ercole-web-with-nginx-and-proxypass).

## Configuration

Ercole-web has a single file and it's stored in `/usr/share/ercole/web/config.json`. The file isn't tought to be modified by hand but it's generated by `ercoleweb-setup` util using the values inside the file `/etc/ercole/conf.d/20-ercolesetup.toml`.

## SSO Configuration

Ercole-web has the possibility to config a Single Sign On login feature, following the below steps (only for the first installation):

- Create a file named `config_sso.json` into the folder `/usr/share/ercole/web/`
- Copy and paste the below content inside the `config_sso.json` file:

```
{
  "auth_url": "",
  "token_url": "",
  "client_id": "",
  "client_id_secret": "",
  "redirect_uri": "",
  "grant_type": "",
  "response_type": "",
  "scope": "",
  "sso_visible": false
}
```

- Fill the `config_sso.json` with the needed information
- Make sure to set `sso_visible` to `true`
- These configuration need to be done only for the first time installation. If you need to change some configuration, change the already existing `config_sso.json`

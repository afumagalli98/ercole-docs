## Ercole agent installation

In order to permit the correct comunication between agent and server, you have to open these port on your firewall from agent to server (one way):

* 9080  if you want http communication protocol
* 443 if you want https communication protocol

::: warning ATTENZIONE
If you want to use https communication protocol, you have to provide a signed certificate
:::

### Operating System support

* Red Hat/Oracle Linux/CentOS 5.x-6.x-7.x (only 7.x for the virtualization agent)
* Microsoft Windows 2008R2 - 2012 - 2012R2 - 2016

### Database support

* Oracle RDBMS 9i 10g 11g 12c 18c 19c 

### RHEL/OEL/CentOS Installation

#### Requirements

* All the Oracle Database must be in the oratab file:

```
# This file is used by ORACLE utilities.  It is created by root.sh
# and updated by either Database Configuration Assistant while creating
# a database or ASM Configuration Assistant while creating ASM instance.

# A colon, ':', is used as the field terminator.  A new line terminates
# the entry.  Lines beginning with a pound sign, '#', are comments.

# Entries are of the form:
#   $ORACLE_SID:$ORACLE_HOME:<N|Y>:
#
# The first and second fields are the system identifier and home
# directory of the database respectively.  The third field indicates
# to the dbstart utility that the database should , "Y", or should not,
# "N", be brought up at system boot time.
#
# Multiple entries with the same $ORACLE_SID are not allowed.
#
#
ERCOLE:/data/app/oracle/product/12.2.0/dbhome_1:N
```

#### Installation

* Install agent as root user:

```
yum install -y https://<ip_ercole_server>/packages/ercole-agent-latest-1.el<5-6-7>.x86_64.rpm
```

* Agent configuration

The installer will create the service "ercole-agent" and the default path will be /opt/ercole-agent.
Before starting the agent, you have to modify the config.json file, located on the installation path. 


| Parameter | Description | Default |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Hostname | if "default" the agent takes the server hostname, otherwise it takes the name written | default |
| envtype | It accepts what you want (es. Production, PRD or PROD) | ercole |
| location | It accepts what you want (es. Italy, IT or DC_IT) | ercole |
| serverurl | Ercole server address | user |
| serverusr | Ercole server user | password |
| serverpsw | Ercole server password | user |
| frequency | Schedulation window in hour (1 in a day by default) | password |
| forcestats | If true it forces DBA_FEATURE_USAGE_STATISTICS refresh (recommended) |  |
| EnableServerValidation | If false it accepts certificate self signed or not acknowledged |  |
| ForcePwshVersion | Insert the powershell version if the version is different (only for windows) |  |
| oratab | Override the default oratab filename |  |

* Now you can start the service:

```
service ercole-agent start
```

You can check the execution through the journalctl (Linux 7): 

```
journalctl -u ercole-agent -f
```

You can find the log on /var/log/ercole-agent.log (Linux 5 & 6).

### Windows installation

#### Requirements

* PowerShell version >= 2

#### Installation

* Download the agent installer from the page "Agent" on the Ercole Server Main page.

* Execute (with administrator privilege) the file ercole-agent-setup-ERCOLE_VERSION.exe 

The installer will create the service "ercole-agent" and the default path will be c:\ercole-agent.

* Agent configuration

Before starting the agent, you have to modify the config.json file, located on the installation path.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Hostname | if "default" the agent takes the server hostname, otherwise it takes the name written | "default" |
| envtype | It accepts what you want (es. Production, PRD or PROD) | ercole |
| location | It accepts what you want (es. Italy, IT or DC_IT) | ercole |
| serverurl | Ercole server address | user |
| serverusr | Ercole server user | password |
| serverpsw | Ercole server password | user |
| frequency | Schedulation window in hour (1 in a day by default) | password |
| forcestats | If true it forces DBA_FEATURE_USAGE_STATISTICS refresh (recommended) |  |
| EnableServerValidation | If false it accepts certificate self signed or not acknowledged |  |
| ForcePwshVersion | Insert the powershell version if the version is different (only for windows) |  |

* Now you can start the service ercole-service.

::: danger DEBUG
If you want to debug the execution of the agent, you can execute it directly into the command line prompt from the base directory (ex. /opt/ercole-agent)
:::
